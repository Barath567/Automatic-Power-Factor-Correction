Earlier, the power factor correction was done by adjusting the capacitor bank manually. 
Automated power factor correction using a capacitive bank helps provide the power factor correction. 
Here, I mainly did the RLC circuit analysis in MATLAB and simulation system using proteus and automated the system using arduino control.
